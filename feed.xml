                <h5><a href="https://autismworks.online/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Autism Works Online</span></a> is a job board to help autistic people find remote jobs, designed and curated by an autistic recruiter.</h5>
<p>The creator of this website is Carolina Fernandes, an autistic person with years of experience as a tech recruiter. It focuses on "remote, low-demand, low-experience" roles, meant to cater to autistic people's different capacities and needs. You can filter for remote jobs by continent (or choose "remote anywhere"), job type, and industry.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Every job description is edited by Carolina to be as simple, straightforward, and easy to understand as possible, with only the minimum information needed to apply.</em></p>
<p><em>This helps reduce the overwhelm people may experience when browsing your typical job board, which is often filled with unnecessary fluff.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There aren't that many jobs posted yet, but this seems like a passion project, so hopefully it will continue developing in time (spoons willing!). In the Autism Works Online newsletter, Carolina has said "I want this to be the softest job board newsletter the internet has ever seen." You can message Carolina to post a job or provide feedback, and she states that she reads every one.</p>
<p>Autistic people are frequently excluded from and burnt out by regular employment! I can personally attest that working remotely is probably the only way I could sustain a full-time job without having to fight off meltdowns all day (and even then, only maybe). I think for those of us with PDA, it can be especially life-saving to have a lower-demand job with more autonomy.</p>
<p>The employment statistics for autistic people are pretty grisly, so as long as capitalism unfortunately remains, websites like this are much needed in this world.</p>

                    <p><img src="https://aylins-autisticresources.org/media/posts/15/finch.png" class="type:primaryImage" alt="screenshot of finch app with pink cartoon bird and goals that say &quot;read 5 pages of a book&quot; and &quot;literally survive the day&quot;" /></p>
                <h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://finchcare.com/">Finch</a></span> is a mobile app where you care for a virtual pet by setting and completing self-care tasks for yourself.</h5>
<p>It was created by Stephanie Yuan and Thomas Aquinas Nugraha Budi to gamify taking care of your mental health. You name and design a "birb" and set daily habits for yourself — anything from drinking water to doing a jig to literally surviving the day.</p>
<p>Every time you complete one of your tasks, your birb gets energized with hearts. Once they have enough, they can set out on an adventure, exploring the world and discovering new things like a child. Eventually, your birb will "evolve" into different stages of life, unlocking more customization options. (The day my little Poppyseed graduated to toddlerdom was a very proud day indeed!)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This app seems particularly useful for anyone who struggles to keep a consistent routine or complete activities of daily living (ADLs). </em></p>
<p><em>Finch only uses positive reinforcement as motivation, with no punishments for not completing tasks. So if you benefit from cute rewards and mildly addictive external incentives to hold you accountable, the birb might be for you.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some other features include <strong>daily quests</strong>, <strong>notifications </strong>to do your tasks, a <strong>mood tracker</strong>, a <strong>journal</strong>, a <strong>focus timer</strong>, the ability to <strong>play with a friend</strong>, and even <strong>micropets </strong>(smaller pets for your already small pet...lol). There is a paid Plus mode, but the core mechanics are not paywalled.</p>
<p>Overall, you can really tell the developers put their whole asses into this app. I started using Finch during an Alice in Wonderland-themed event with special items, storylines, and animations that I found surprisingly elaborate! There's plenty of novelty and collectibles here on top of the desire to keep your bird-like companion happy, both of which help keep you from getting bored and quitting.</p>
<p>It's available for both <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.finch.finch&amp;hl=en_US">Android</a></span> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/finch-self-care-pet/id1528595748"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Apple</span></a> devices. :)</p>

<p>It's written by Louise Gooding, a neurodivergent author with ADHD, who writes children's books about neurodiversity and disability.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This book starts by showing how brains work on a scientific level — neurons, synapses, neurotransmitters, and how messages are relayed to and from your brain. </em></p>
<p><em>Then, it specifically explains autism, ADHD, Tourette's syndrome, dyslexia, dyspraxia, OCD, and other forms of neurodivergence in an impressive amount of detail for a kids' book while still being quite accessible.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gooding goes into the <strong>history </strong>of these diagnoses, <strong>traits </strong>that people may exhibit, neurodivergent <strong>famous/historical figures</strong>, and some <strong>supports </strong>that can help. She even includes an explanation of <strong>masking</strong>, an incredibly important element of neurodivergence for children to learn about.</p>
<p>I read it before giving it to my elementary school teacher aunt for Christmas and felt like I was learning things even as a fully grown adult ;)</p>
<p>I also appreciate the positive, empathetic way this book presents neurodivergence. For example, it shows the rainbow infinity symbol for autism instead of the puzzle piece (and even discusses that choice explicitly) in a spread about awareness and acceptance.</p>
<p>It's a pretty cool book, so get it for the kid in your life if you want them to understand their own neurotype and/or not be an asshat to people with other neurotypes. ^^</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Note</em></span>: One page references the statistic about how more boys are diagnosed with autism than girls. The only thing I would add to this book (and did add to the copy I gave my aunt) is an asterisk saying that girls and women tend to be diagnosed less often because of societal sexism. This might be a beneficial conversation to have with kids as well!</p>

<p>Her content focuses on neurodivergence and disability from a Chinese cross-cultural lens. She has interesting text posts about how certain autism-related topics and forms of advocacy have been received by Chinese communities, as well as stories about her own experiences.</p>
<p>Many of her posts counter assumptions that are common in online English-speaking autistic spaces, often discussing how privilege can affect perceptions of autistic people and access to support/diagnosis in different locations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Western autistic conversations tend to be quite Eurocentric, and the intersection of Chinese cultural identity and autism is rarely represented. </em></p>
<p><em>This account offers one unique, incredibly important perspective when thinking about how various facets of autism might be translated between different cultures, languages, and populations.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I recommend her account to anyone who would like to widen their understanding of autistic conversations outside of just white American or European contexts!</p>

                <h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.inclusivetherapists.com/">Inclusive Therapists</a></span> is a website to help you find affirming, social justice-oriented mental health providers with certain identities and specialties.</h5>
<p>This website states that they are a "mental health liberation movement creating change through <strong>decolonial education, collective care, and activism</strong>." Even today, a lot of therapy is not so <a href="https://www.decolonizingtherapy.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">decolonized</span></a>, so such a mission statement is a damn good sign. They also have anti-carceral <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.inclusivetherapists.com/resources">mental health resources</a></span> and a <a href="https://mentalhealthliberation.org/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">nonprofit organization</span></a>.</p>
<p>You can search for providers by Advocacy Focus, Cultural Identity, Language, Provider's Identity, and more. Each therapist adds tags to show their <strong>services/therapeutic approaches</strong> (e.g. body positivity, gender-affirming care letters, disability justice, etc.) and <strong>their own identities</strong> (e.g. biracial/multiracial, person of color or global majority, LGBQ+ sexuality, transgender, etc.). And if you want more direct help, you can fill out a form via their free <a href="https://www.inclusivetherapists.com/get-matched"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">matching service</span></a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I've found that many therapists describe themselves as just "neurodivergent" on other websites without specifying whether they're autistic, possibly for safety/anti-discrimination reasons. So for autistic clients, it is incredibly helpful to be able to see the very clear "Autistic Person" tag here. </em></p>
<p><em>I would personally recommend looking for the "<a href="https://aylins-autisticresources.org/post-2/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Autism-Affirming or Centered Therapy</span></a>" and "Autistic Person Opposing ABA" tags as well!</em> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another cool tag I spotted is "Cultural Resistance Against Systemic Oppression," if you'd prefer to rage against the system (i.e. our collective oppression) and not unduly against yourself (an individual inside of an unjust system). I'd consider this another promising indicator of decolonized therapy.</p>
<p>All in all, I've found this to be a great resource when searching for neuro-affirming therapy, especially as a holder of Many Identities™. So if you're looking for an autistic therapist, or one who shares particular ideals and/or demographics with you, this is a mighty useful website to consult!</p>

                <h5>The <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.autisticculturepodcast.com/podcast">Autistic Culture Podcast</a></span></em> is/was a podcast that reimagines autism as a cultural difference as well as a neurological one. </h5>
<p>For the first approximately 129 episodes of this podcast, the hosts were Matt Lowry, LPP and Dr. Angela Kingdon, who discussed various sociocultural aspects of Autistic culture (as opposed to the dominant neurotypical culture we live in). In the imagined <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.mattlowrylpp.com/blog/autistica">Land of Autistica</a></span>, a fable written by Matt, autistic people are surrounded by their own neurokin in a world made for them, unlike the world of forced neurotypicality.</p>
<p>The podcast delved into the history of autistic contributions to society and did Autistic Advocacy episodes on important issues that affect our community. I found the humor between the hosts to be pretty delightful, and the conversations it had were super important in a society that often seeks to "fix" autism instead of accommodate or embrace it.</p>
<p>This is quite a well-known autistic podcast, and the first ~100ish episodes are largely a funny and informative listen that provided me with a sort of pseudo-<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.autisticculturepodcast.com/p/autistic-podcast-autistic-centered-therapy">autistic therapy</a></span> during a time when I needed it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>It's not a perfect podcast, but it genuinely meant a lot to me to hear two autistic adults have fun together and explore the wonders of Autistica. I sincerely wish it were a real place I could visit.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, Matt is no longer a host; however, I still recommend the original first ~three seasons of the podcast for their quality and enjoyability. Feel free to check out Matt's new podcast, the <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.mattlowrylpp.com/voice">Autistic V.O.I.C.E. Project</a></span></em>, as well.</p>

<p>It's run by Dr. Natalie Engelbrecht and Eva Silvertant, who are both autistic (and seem to have a pretty hardcore special interest in autism ;). </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Embrace Autism is well known for having many clinically validated <a href="https://embrace-autism.com/autism-tests/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">autism questionnaires</span></a> that you can do at home for free. This is super helpful, since official assessments are not always easily accessible.</em></p>
<p><em>However, if you do want to go the formal route, you can also book an assessment with one of their neurodivergent practitioners if you'd like. (Bring your binder full of test scores with you!)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Part of my early autism journey was obsessively taking every single inventory on this website to try to figure out whether I might be autistic. Unsurprisingly, the answer was a choral, harmonized, resounding <em>yes</em>... from all of them. :) It's a great place to start if you're wondering whether you might be as well.</p>
<p>On top of that, they also have hundreds of blog posts on a diverse variety of autism-related subjects. Some I found particularly interesting are "<a href="https://embrace-autism.com/selective-mutism-in-autistic-adults/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Selective Mutism in Autistic Adults</span></a>," "<a href="https://embrace-autism.com/finding-an-autism-affirming-therapist/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Finding an Autism-Affirming Therapist</span></a>," and "<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://embrace-autism.com/autism-and-disorganized-thoughts/">Autism and Disorganized Thoughts</a></span>" (or nonlinear thinking). Their wealth of content is so fascinating and well researched that it was VERY HARD to tear myself away from it in order to write this!</p>
<p>Overall, Embrace Autism's combination of online self-assessments, charming graphic design, and empowering messages make it an ideal hub of autism-affirming information, especially for people who are just starting to explore whether they may be autistic.</p>

<p>This book is a great introduction to autism, especially if you're a high-masking autistic person with a non-stereotypical presentation of traits. You'll learn how maskers camouflage and mimic neurotypical social cues to "blend in" and survive, which can, of course, lead to autistic burnout and exhaustion.</p>
<p>It also features research and personal stories of late-diagnosed individuals, especially people in the LGBTQ+ community and other marginalized groups. Price is a transgender, autistic social psychologist himself, which is much-needed representation in the field.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Importantly, Price argues that the world needs to change to be more accepting and accommodating of autistic people, not the other way around.</em></p>
<p><em>The book feels validating, educational, and neurodivergence-positive, which is especially ideal if you're new to the big, sometimes daunting world of autism.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was the first book about autism I ever read, and boy am I glad it was this one. It's pretty well-known for being the go-to inclusive book for the socially conscious, enlightened autie. It even has advice on finding autistic community, which is incredibly beneficial for readers who might feel increasingly alone when discovering their neurotype for the first time.</p>
<p>Ironically, this book made me realize that I am in fact not high-masking, or masking at all! (Except for some stimming that I can sort of hide when needed.) Nor am I particularly non-stereotypical. However, if even my stereotypical autistic ass gleaned something from this book, that's a pretty good sign for everyone else. ;)</p>
<p>There's also a sequel to this book called <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/unmasking-for-life-the-autistic-person-s-guide-to-connecting-loving-and-living-authentically-devon-price-phd/8f56261bb34b67ca?ean=9780593735756&amp;next=t&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=%7Bcampaignname%7D&amp;utm_content=6443417794&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=16235479093&amp;gbraid=0AAAAACfld43NWHsyz8C-vyzn047pEyHeV&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA7fbLBhDJARIsAOAqhseIDnUuxINrzFgYHrAvWSHXhN_ELU2VdPDvj1Zvp2l6GeCrJqcbTyoaAs9mEALw_wcB"><em>Unmasking for Life: The Autistic Person's Guide to Connecting, Loving, and Living Authentically</em></a></span>, if you're looking for more.</p>

                <h5><a href="https://www.yourfocusfriend.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Focus Friend</span></a> is a cute, bean-themed focus timer app by Hank Green and Honey B Games to help you stop using your phone so damn much.</h5>
<p>This app bestows upon you a cozy little bean friend who knits socks. When you click the FOCUS! button, lil' Beanie (or whatever you named them) starts knitting and locks your phone. During this time, you cannot access any other app. When you're done, you can spend the socks you earned on adorable furniture to decorate Beanie's home.</p>
<p>If you violate this and interrupt Beanie's knitting to use your phone, they get very sad. :( You don't want to make Beanie <em>sad</em>, do you? Bean tears are notoriously acidic! (Which is to say, making you feel guilt and shame for disappointing a cartoon bean is the tactic at play here. It's pretty effective.)</p>
<p>Focus Friend is marketed as especially useful for people with ADHD, but I think it's helpful even for non-ADHD autistic people like me, who might struggle to transition from "looking at your phone" to "not looking at your phone and doing literally anything else." :)</p>

<p class="msg"><em>It's certainly not the only focus timer app out there, but it may well be the most charming.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The app runs on optional in-game purchases (no ads) and is available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.underthing.focus.friend&amp;hl=en_US"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Android</span></a> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/focus-friend-by-hank-green/id6742278016">Apple</a></span> devices for free!</p>

                <h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://howwefeel.org/"><em>How We Feel</em></a></span> is a mobile journaling app designed by therapists and scientists at the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://ycei.org/" target="_blank" data-v-735c43b9="" rel="noopener">Yale University Center for Emotional Intelligence</a></span> to help you name and track your emotions throughout the day.</h5>
<p>The app taps you on the shoulder (via notifications) once or twice a day, or however frequently you want it to, and asks how you're feeling in that moment. You can type it in the search bar if you already have a word for what you're feeling.</p>
<p>But if you need help naming it, you can browse through the emotions on the feelings wheel, which are organized by <strong><em>arousal </em></strong>(high or low) and <strong><em>valence </em></strong>(positive or negative). For example, "excited" is listed as a high energy, pleasant emotion, whereas "disconnected" is a low energy, unpleasant emotion.</p>
<p>Each emotion has a specific description, which is helpful for choosing between similar feelings, such as "angry" and "furious." The differences can be somewhat subjective, but I usually at least somewhat agree with their definitions.</p>
<p>Once you choose a feeling, you're asked what might be making you feel that way. You can quickly pick customizable tags for <em><strong>themes </strong></em>(e.g. driving, resting, reading, gaming), <em><strong>people </strong></em>(e.g. friends, family, co-workers, alone), and <em><strong>places </strong></em>(e.g. home, school, work). This has really helped me notice how certain situations and activities consistently make me feel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How We Feel <em>is especially handy for people with alexithymia, which can make it hard to recognize or describe your feelings.</em></p>
<p><em>When there's literally a log of your emotions and what caused them colorfully staring you in the face, it's pretty hard to deny the patterns that show up.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The design of the app is beautiful and easy to use as well, with each emotion taking a unique shape evocative of that feeling. It's available on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.howwefeel.moodmeter&amp;hl=en_US">Android</a></span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/how-we-feel/id1562706384">Apple</a></span> devices for free!</p>
