                <h5><a href="https://www.mattlowrylpp.com/blog/act-83tka"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Autistic-Centered Therapy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (AuCT)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a kind of therapy designed by and for autistic people. According to Matt Lowry, LPP, it's "equal parts trauma work, advocacy work, autistic interpersonal therapy, and automotive [body] maintenance."</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I came across the idea of autistic-centered therapy through Matt Lowry and Dr. Angela Kingdon's Autistic Culture Podcast, where they did an </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.autisticculturepodcast.com/p/autistic-podcast-autistic-centered-therapy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">episode about AuCT</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It reimagines what therapy might look like if it affirmed neurodivergence, encouraged autistic coping strategies, and were administered by an autistic therapist who understands and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">uses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> autistic communication styles themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most common kind of therapy in the US is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), and my personal experience as an autistic person is that multiple facets of it simply do not work for me. In some cases, they can actually harm my mental health, even if delivered with nothing but good intentions. These sentiments have been echoed by many autistic people who find that most available types of therapy are either made for neurotypical/allistic people or attempts to "fix" our autism. Neither is ideal!</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concept of AuCT gives me some hope for a world where autism-affirming therapy is accessible to anyone who needs it.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It made me feel much more educated on what to look for when searching for a therapist myself. Thus, I highly recommend this article and podcast episode to any autistic person who feels like traditional therapy might not be for them, as well as any clinician interested in learning more about how to support autistic clients.</span></p>

                <h5>Monotropism is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.bps.org.uk/psychologist/me-and-monotropism-unified-theory-autism">unified theory of autism</a></span> created by autistic people that explains autistic traits in terms of "monotropic," or singularly and intensely focused, attention.</h5>
<p>It was developed by Dr. Dinah Murray, Dr. Wenn Lawson, and Mike Lesser. This article about it was written by Dr. Murray's adult child, Fergus Murray, both of whom were/are autistic themselves.</p>
<p>Many people's understanding of autism is still extremely deficit-based. On the other hand, the theory of monotropism is one of the first, most prominent theories of autism that sees autistic traits primarily as differences, not deficiencies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I was still confused about whether I was autistic or not, reading this article was what made it all make sense. It does a shockingly cohesive job of tying seemingly disparate autistic traits together with the common thread of singular, intense focus.</p>
<p>I've recommended it to countless people since when trying to explain the root of what autism is all about, as I think it's a great starting point.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fergus Murray also has a website called <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://monotropism.org/">monotropism.org</a></span> with more details on the history of the theory, its applications, and other articles and papers on monotropism.</p>
