You'll learn how maskers camouflage and mimic neurotypical social cues to \"blend in\" and survive, which can, of course, lead to autistic burnout and exhaustion.</p>\n<p>It also features research and personal stories of late-diagnosed individuals, especially people in the LGBTQ+ community and other marginalized groups. Price is a transgender social psychologist himself, which is much-needed representation in the field.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Importantly, Price argues that the world needs to change to be more accepting and accommodating of autistic people, not the other way around.</em></p>\n<p><em>The book feels validating, educational, and neurodivergence-positive, which is especially ideal if you're new to the big, sometimes daunting world of autism.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This was the first book about autism I ever read, and boy am I glad it was this one. It's pretty well-known for being the go-to inclusive book for the socially conscious, enlightened autie. It even has advice on finding autistic community, which is incredibly beneficial for readers who might feel increasingly alone when discovering their neurotype for the first time.</p>\n<p>Ironically, this book made me realize that I am in fact not high-masking, or masking at all! (Except for some stimming that I can sort of hide when needed.) Nor am I particularly non-stereotypical. However, if even my stereotypical autistic ass gleaned something from this book, that's a pretty good sign for everyone else. ;)</p>\n<p>There's also a sequel to this book called <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/p/books/unmasking-for-life-the-autistic-person-s-guide-to-connecting-loving-and-living-authentically-devon-price-phd/8f56261bb34b67ca?ean=9780593735756&amp;next=t&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=%7Bcampaignname%7D&amp;utm_content=6443417794&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=16235479093&amp;gbraid=0AAAAACfld43NWHsyz8C-vyzn047pEyHeV&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA7fbLBhDJARIsAOAqhseIDnUuxINrzFgYHrAvWSHXhN_ELU2VdPDvj1Zvp2l6GeCrJqcbTyoaAs9mEALw_wcB\"><em>Unmasking for Life: The Autistic Person's Guide to Connecting, Loving, and Living Authentically</em></a></span>, if you're looking for more.</p>",

When you click the FOCUS! button, lil' Beanie (or whatever you named them) starts knitting and locks your phone. During this time, you cannot access any other app. When you're done, you can spend the socks you earned on adorable furniture to decorate Beanie's home.</p>\n<p>If you violate this and interrupt Beanie's knitting to use your phone, they get very sad. :( You don't want to make Beanie <em>sad</em>, do you? Bean tears are notoriously acidic! (Which is to say, making you feel guilt and shame for disappointing a cartoon bean is the tactic at play here. It's pretty effective.)</p>\n<p>Focus Friend is marketed as especially useful for people with ADHD, but I think it's helpful even for non-ADHD autistic people like me, who might struggle to transition from \"looking at your phone\" to \"not looking at your phone and doing literally anything else.\" :)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"msg\"><em>It's certainly not the only focus timer app out there, but it may well be the most charming.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The app runs on optional in-game purchases (no ads) and is available on <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.underthing.focus.friend&amp;hl=en_US\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Android</span></a> and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/focus-friend-by-hank-green/id6742278016\">Apple</a></span> devices for free!</p>",

You can type it in the search bar if you already have a word for what you're feeling.</p>\n<p>But if you need help naming it, you can browse through the emotions on the feelings wheel, which are organized by <strong><em>arousal </em></strong>(high or low) and <strong><em>valence </em></strong>(positive or negative). For example, \"excited\" is listed as a high energy, pleasant emotion, whereas \"disconnected\" is a low energy, unpleasant emotion.</p>\n<p>Each emotion has a specific description, which is helpful for choosing between similar feelings, such as \"angry\" and \"furious.\" The differences can be somewhat subjective, but I usually at least somewhat agree with their definitions.</p>\n<p>Once you choose a feeling, you're asked what might be making you feel that way. You can quickly pick customizable tags for <em><strong>themes </strong></em>(e.g. driving, resting, reading, gaming), <em><strong>people </strong></em>(e.g. friends, family, co-workers, alone), and <em><strong>places </strong></em>(e.g. home, school, work).

In addition, her videos on monotropism and masking are excellent introductions to the topics, and her advice videos are always quite thorough.
